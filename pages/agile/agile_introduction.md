## What is Agile?

Agile is a different way of managing IT development teams and projects. It is based on iterative development where software is built incrementally from the start, instead of trying to deliver it all at once.
## Why we use Agile

To achieve our goals we have adopted the Agile Scrum methodology.
* Bootstrap framework
* [Navgoco multi-level sidebar](http://www.komposta.net/article/navgoco) for table of contents
* Ability to specify different sidebars for different products
* Top navigation bar with drop-down menus
* Notes, tips, and warning information notes
* Tags for alternative navigation
* Advanced landing page layouts from the [Modern Business theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/).
