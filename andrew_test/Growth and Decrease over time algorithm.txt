Choose a granularity g (1mile, 500 meeters, etc.)
In theory the map is now divided into gxg size boxes. To get the box key use the formula key=lat/g,lng/g (modifying g to be in units of lat/lng)
Gradients don't seem to be a good option. Instead we're going to have to use colored polygons to color each area.
For each survey, calculate how much time they spent in each area. Get average sigtings/unit of time for two different time frames.
If the later time frame has a higher sighting rate, color orange/red. Use green/blue for a decrease. Use black if not enough data exists (EG, box key was only created for one of the two timeframes). Use yellow if stayed the same.
Keep track of highest and lowest values so that a legend can be generated.
